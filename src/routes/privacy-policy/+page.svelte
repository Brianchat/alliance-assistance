	<p>
		<b>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact
			with our Services, including:</b>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>To facilitate account creation and authentication and otherwise manage user accounts.&nbsp;</b>We may

	<h2 id="legalbases" >3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>In Short:&nbsp;</b>We only process your personal information when we believe it is
		necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law,
		like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or
		fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business
		interests.
	</p>
	<p><b>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</b></p>
	<p>
		The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal
		bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the
		following legal bases to process your personal information:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Consent.&nbsp;</b>We may process your information if you have given us permission
			(i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your
			consent at any time. Learn more about&nbsp;<a href="/privacy-policy/#withdrawconsent">withdrawing your
				consent</a>.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Legal Obligations.</b> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary
			for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or
			regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence
			in litigation in which we are involved.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Vital Interests.</b> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary
			to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving
			potential threats to the safety of any person.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		In legal terms, we are generally the `data controller` under European data protection laws of
		the personal information described in this privacy notice, since we determine the means and/or
		purposes of the data processing we perform. This privacy notice does not apply to the personal
		information we process as a `data processor` on behalf of our customers. In those situations,
		the customer that we provide services to and with whom we have entered into a data processing
		agreement is the `data controller` responsible for your personal information, and we merely
		process your information on their behalf in accordance with your instructions. If you want to
		know more about our customers` privacy practices, you should read their privacy policies and
		direct any questions you have to them.
	</p>
	<p><b>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</b></p>
	<p>
		We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. express consent)
		to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission
		can be inferred (i.e. implied consent). You can&nbsp;<a href="/privacy-policy/#withdrawconsent">withdraw your
			consent</a>&nbsp;at any time.
	</p>
	<p>
		In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your
		information without your consent, including, for example:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a
			timely way
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process,
			or settle an insurance claim
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of
			financial abuse
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the
			availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes
			related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or
			a province
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the
			court relating to the production of records
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession
			and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>

	<h2 id="whoshare">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>In Short:</b>&nbsp;We may share information in specific situations described in
		this section and/or with the following third parties.
	</p>
	<p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Business Transfers.</b> We may share or transfer your information in connection with,
			or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all
			or a portion of our business to another company.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="sociallogins">5. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>In Short:&nbsp;</b>If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a
		social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media
		account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will
		receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile
		information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often
		include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other
		information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.
	</p>
	<p>
		We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy
		notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do
		not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your
		third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to
		understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your
		privacy preferences on their sites and apps.
	</p>
	<h2 id="inforetain">6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>In Short:&nbsp;</b>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the
		purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.
	</p>
	<p>
		We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set
		out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law
		(such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require
		us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an
		account with us .
	</p>
	<p>
		When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will
		either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because
		your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your
		personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
	</p>
	<h2 id="infosafe">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>In Short:&nbsp;</b>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
		organisational and technical security measures.
	</p>
	<p>
		We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures
		designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our
		safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet
		or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or
		guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to
		defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although
		we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information
		to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a
		secure environment.
	</p>
	<h2 id="privacyrights">8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>In Short:</b>&nbsp; In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA),
		United Kingdom (UK), and Canada , you have rights that allow you greater access to and control
		over your personal information. &nbsp;You may review, change, or terminate your account at any
		time.
	</p>
	<p>
		In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada ), you have certain rights under applicable data
		protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your
		personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing
		of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain
		circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal
		information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided
		in the section ` <a href="/privacy-policy/#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a> ` below.
	</p>
	<p>
		We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
	</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>
		If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal
		information, you also have the right to complain to your <a
			href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">Member State data
			protection authority</a>
		or&nbsp;<a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/data-protection-complaints/data-protection-complaints/">UK
			data protection authority</a>.

	<p>
		If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the <a
			href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html">Federal Data Protection and Information
			Commissioner</a>.
	</p>
	<p id="withdrawconsent">
		<b>Withdrawing your consent:</b> If we are relying on your consent to process your
		personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable
		law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at
		any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section `
		<a href="/privacy-policy/#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a> ` below .
	</p>
	<p>
		However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its
		withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal
		information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
	</p>
	<p><b>Account Information</b></p>
	<p>
		If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate
		your account, you can:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and
		information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to
		prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms
		and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at dpo@enque.org .
	</p>
	<h2 id="DNT">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
	<p>
		Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
		Do-Not-Track ( `DNT` ) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not
		to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
		uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised . As
		such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
		automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
		tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in
		a revised version of this privacy notice.
	</p>
	<h2 id="caresidents">10. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
	<p>
		<b>In Short:&nbsp;</b>Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted
		specific rights regarding access to your personal information.
	</p>
	<p>
		California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the `Shine The Light` law, permits our
		users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of
		charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third
		parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with
		which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a
		California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing
		to us using the contact information provided below.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with
		Services, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the
		Services. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information
		provided below and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that
		you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Services,
		but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our
		systems (e.g. backups, etc.).
	</p>
	<p><b>CCPA Privacy Notice</b></p>

		methods as the circumstances dictate.

		We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or
		authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional
		information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your
		identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
		additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or

		finish verifying you.
